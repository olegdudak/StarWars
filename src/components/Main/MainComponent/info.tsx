      <div className="text text-2xl text-justify">In 1971, Universal Studios initially agreed to make "American Graffiti"
           and Star Wars under a single contract for both films, but the second film was later rejected again
           at the concept stage. "Graffiti" was filmed until 1973, and a few months later Lucas wrote "Journal
           villas", which tells the story of the legendary knights of the Jedi Band order.<p></p>Upset that his story
           was too difficult to understand, from April 17, 1973 he begins to write a 13-page text
           under the name "Star Wars" (eng. The Star Wars), for which he drew inspiration from the film Akira
           Kurosawa "Three scoundrels in the hidden fortress". By 1974, he had expanded The Wars to the extent of
           draft script, coming up with elements such as the Sith Order, the Death Star, and the main character
           named Annikin Starkiller (English Annikin Starkiller). From among Lucas' sources of inspiration
           series of fantastic works about Flash Gordon, Perry Rodan, and works about
           Barsoom (Mars) by Edgar Burroughs. The story was divided into episodes from which to film
           Lucas chose the fourth, in his opinion the easiest to understand and the most interesting. On the set
           advanced special effects technologies were used (in particular, chromakey), and the plot used
           scheme of the monomyth. During the work on the script, many characters and locations underwent drastic changes
           changes Despite the predictions, the film released in 1977 was a huge success.<p></p>The film "Star Wars" founded
           trilogy, which included episodes IV, V and VI of the original script. George Lucas got to shoot them
           more funds than for the original film, which allowed to fully implement the plan. Yes, it came out in 1980
           released Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, and 1983's Star Wars: Return of the Jedi.
           Tapes have become revolutionary in several areas. The first film became a blockbuster without movie stars among the actors.
           Together with the sequels, it formed a single story with a cross-cutting plot, setting the model for future film trilogies.
           Each film collected more than $200 million, a huge sum for its time. In addition, "Star Wars" showed that on
           merchandising can be more profitable than even the films themselves. The hype around the tapes
           prompted the company LucasArts, founded by Lucas, to release related products: toys, novels and comics.
          <p></p>In 1999, a new trilogy of films was founded, based on episodes I, II and III of the original plan. They became them
           accordingly released in 1999 "The Hidden Threat", in 2002 "Attack of the Clones" and in 2005 "Revenge of the Sith". For theirs
           computer graphics were actively used in its creation. Along with the prequel trilogy, it was reissued
           the original trilogy with re-editing and adding new effects. The tapes also became successful, however
           was sometimes criticized for abandoning classic effects, acting and delving into the depiction of politics
           and experiences of the characters of "The Far Galaxy" instead of the "fairy tale" confrontation between good and evil.</div>

          <div className="text text-2xl pb-7 text-justify">In Ukraine, the influence of "Star Wars" has had an impact on politics through the performance
           political actions and the candidacy of persons named Darth Vader for important political positions (see Darth
           Vader in Ukrainian politics). In particular, Vader Dart Viktorovych headed the election list "Internet
